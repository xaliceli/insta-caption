# insta-caption

Given a list of public IG profiles, identifies single-subject portraits based on accessibility captions, then downloads the image and corresponding caption. Uses simple Markov chains to generate new captions that accompany facial averages composed of scraped photos. This is a super quick implementation that does not use the IG API and only accesses the first 12 posts that load upon opening each profile.
